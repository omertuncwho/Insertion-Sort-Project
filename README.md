# Insertion-Sort-Project
## Project 1:
####:[22,27,16,2,18,6] -> Insertion Sort
Steps according to the Insertion Sort algorithm:
Step: [22] (27, 16, 2, 18, 6)
Step: [22, 27] (16, 2, 18, 6)
Step: [16, 22, 27] (2, 18, 6)
Step: [2, 16, 22, 27] (18, 6)
Step: [2, 16, 18, 22, 27] (6)
Step: [2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

####:Big-O Notation:
The Big-O notation for Insertion Sort is O(n^2).

####:Time Complexity:
After the array is sorted, for the number 18:

####:Average Case:
If we assume it's in the middle, O(n/2)
####:Worst Case: 
If it's at the end, O(n)
####: Best Case: 
If it's at the beginning, O(1)

####:[7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] according to Selection Sort:

A:
Step: [2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6]
Step: [2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 5, 15, 6]
Step: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8, 15, 6]
Step: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 15, 7]
These are the first 4 steps of Selection Sort for the given array.
